              ChickenSnake, is a video production hub founded by Arnab Moitra,
              the madman ! Acting as an 'axis' where 50+ handpicked artists are
              involved, ChickenSnake provides Film & Photography Services for
              Weddings, Music Videos, Corporate ADs and many more. â€‹We
              collaborate with Media houses, Consultants and Brands towards
              creating one of the most distinctive Films independently. At
              ChickenSnake, the term 'concept' is taken a little seriously and
              the thought of 'experiment' - a little curiously ! The blend of
              both makes it all.
